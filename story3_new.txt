laer had surpassed him in studies while pooja by introducing rishi to her typical indian joint family 
expressed her feelings for him received a posive response ravi failed in the ﬁrst semester

inspired from his father but not to feel bulldozed by it during campus placements ravi secured a 
good job making his father girlfriend pallavi and the laers father a good friend of ravis father 
delighted pooja rejected a job at infosys to be with rishi in the us as he had thrown an oﬀer for his 
ai-operang system idea to origin which was accepted 



however rishi suggested that he and pooja should put an end to their relaonship mutually as he 
felt that she would become an obstacle to his career and said she was a burden in his heart and 
hearing that she le when ravi tries to apprehend rishi to not break up with pooja it leads to a 
fallout between them as the last semester examinaons approached rishi was accused of stealing 
the queson papers which was actually a conspiracy engineered by ajay to stop him from aempng 
his exams however upon geng a clue that proved the allegaon against rishi wrong the police let

ranks becoming a leading execuve in origin during his presentaon about his project rishi learned 
that his father succumbed to his illness in his sleep and passed away upon returning to india he 
realised that his father loved him more than anything and missed him as rishi barely spoke to him 
rishi remained distraught over not being able to talk to his father hearully 



at present rishi inquires chandrashekar about ravi post which the former discloses that ravi was 
ruscated from the university as he had taken the blame for the allegaon against rishi to protect 
him that caused his father to commit suicide devastated and guilty upon being advised by his 
mother rishi takes a long-term leave and ﬂies to india with her and kanna to take ravi with him to 
the usa he meets ravi in his nave village ramavaram protesng alone against a pipeline transport 
project that requires the demolion of ramavaram among several other villages some of which have 
already been demolished making ramavaram the next immediate target while pallavis father the 
villages representave what doesnt want to leave the village but is helpless tries negoang fair 

prices for the land the villagers are supposed to leave ravi never wants the project to take place but 
receives no support for his protest rishi realising that ravi would never go with him decides to get 
him what he wants he meets the chief minister of andhra pradesh what claims that he is helpless as 
one of the most inﬂuenal businessmen vivek mial is handling the project 



rishi meets vivek requesng him to exclude ramanavaram but he refuses to oblige rishi aracts 
the media by seng up an oﬃce in ramavaram to manage his schedule and pooja a team leader in 
a reputed video gaming company is sent along with her colleague to ramavaram to meet rishi and 
negoate a collaboraon by making excuses rishi asks her and her colleague to stay in ramavaram 
and work on her video game idea intending to reconcile but pooja has no intenons of doing so as 
she was heartbroken already and stays there under compulsion at ravis house when rishi divulges 
to the media that he has set up his oﬃce for his friend the media asks ravi about his intenons 
behind refusing to go with rishi ravi reveals his aachment to the nave village inspiring several 
other villagers to take up an iniave to join the protest amassing great aenon naonwide 
pallavis father what blames ravi for his fathers death is now against his relaonship with pallavi 
upon learning about this rishi talks to pallavis father making him aware of ravis sacriﬁce post 
which pallavis father decides to accept her relaonship with ravi due to this act of him pooja 
decides to reconcile with rishi while several other villages join the protest 



vivek upon sensing trouble due to the protest arrives at ramavaram and out of ego decides to 
quote a higher compensaon aracng a group of people amongst the protestors as a result ravi is 
stabbed by the henchmen of a neighbouring villages head what is bribed by vivek but rishi rescues 
him from being murdered and he is hospitalised vivek in an interview accuses rishi of demanding a 
share in the project from him and claims that as a result of his rejecon started making use of ravi 
he quesons where rishi was all these years and why ravi is remembered when he is protesng 
pooja too suspects rishis intenons and blames him for ravis situaon and says he has not changed 
a bit which broke his heart the most and he decided to leave the village however his mother 
encourages rishi by revealing that satyanarayana was not a failure passed his upsc examinaons 
and got selected for the interview but was arrested for protesng in favour of suppressed farmers 
leading to him being disqualiﬁed but he never regreed and treated it as a failure because it was for 
a good cause rishi goes back to ramavaram to ﬁnish what he started and a farmer inspires him to 
culvate rishi also leases lands to the farmers encouraging them to get into agriculture quong a 
higher price than vivek later in a press meeng rishi delivers a heart-wrenching speech about how 
farmers are mistreated and taken advantage of leading to several suicides the farmers realise the 
value of their lands and refuse to go with the pipeline project and pooja reconciles with rishi aer 
seeing his speech ajay what has now realised his mistake and is a leading bank oﬃcial exposes 
viveks fraudulent intenons to evade debts behind iniang the project and acquiring the lands as 
a consequence the project is shelved and vivek is arrested 



its me for rishi to go to the usa back to his job but he decides not to realising that his happiness 
lies in the village he resigns as the ceo of origin and resorts to geng into agriculture
